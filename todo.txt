ToDo list, as of April 10, 2015:
--------------------------------
- collect idle rate, queue length statistics
    - hpx3 (Nick)
    - Hpx5 (kevin)
- clean up MPI implementation
- Refactor the communication API
- Refactor the instrumentation API (consistently handle name/address?)
- Get more application cases for HPX5
    - miniAMR
- Find multi-objective optimization case (1D stencil?)
    - # threads
    - decomposition granularity
- Use Cases:
    - Changing queue order from FIFO -> LIFO
    - Triggering repartition (1D stencil)
    - Triggering AMR
    - Triggering load balance
    - Triggering algorithm change
    - Triggering device change (GPU, Phi example)
    - Throttling for memory (monitor headroom?)
- Make APEX 0.1 release.
- Refine OMPT support
    - make 1D stencil task example?
    - Polychronopolous OpenMP SC paper
    - Change OpenMP runtime options at runtime with policy?
- Make event generation asynchronous? - i.e. return to worker as fast as possible
- validate PAPI support
- segregate examples and tests
- validate test output
- Verify TAU support
    - HPX-3
        - Trace
    - HPX-5
        - Profile
        - Trace
- set up buildbot to test all configuration combinations?
    - Active Harmony
    - TAU
    - PAPI
    - MPI
    - OMPT
- APEX should do a global reduction before dumping the profile to the screen. 
  Currently only the master process data is dumped.
    - Related: the reduction feature should take a list of profiles, not just one.  
      The list can be just one, of course.
    - Step 1: worker nodes write number of timers/counters to memory location
    - Step 2: root node gets number of timers/counters from each node
    - Step 3: worker nodes write profiles to memory location (strings! how!)
    - Step 4: root node gets profiles/counters from each node
- Modify the remote "steal" as a policy?
- Experiments without APEX:
    - Run application in parametric mode, with variable numbers of HPX threads.
        - libPXGL - sssp
        - miniAMR
- Apex for MPI_T? Using MPI
- RIOS - should RIOS be providing power, temperature, network, disk, etc. 
  status information? That is, should we be going through RCR/RIOS to get these 
  things, rather than /proc?
- Get LULESH benchmark for Jesus 
- ompss example?
- ARGO opportunities?
- Dynamic adaption to perturbation/variation?
- AMR example?
- APEX API refactoring.  Needs to be done!
- Items from meeting with LSU:
    - Need to double check that APEX doesn't lock worker threads
      (use HPX semaphore)
    - Need to double-check thread synchronization in APEX in general.
      (see above)
    - Set up a build-bot? (buildbot)
    - Idle rate is a good proxy for memory bandwidth saturation 
    - Partition size controls work granularity in 1D stencil.
    - STAR is a good example for load balancing.
    - profiler_listener should be HPX thread, and use HPX 
      semaphore (user level signaling) instead of OS level signaling.
    - get_profile should return a const pointer to an apex_profiler object
    - Add more self-validating tests to HPX-3, HPX-5 
    - Add apex_yield() function. (done - April 9, 2015)
- Move from googlecode to github (done - April 6, 2015)
- Change HPX-3 APEX integration from submodule to git cmake macro (done - April 9, 2015)


Completed ToDo list, as of April 10, 2015:
------------------------------------------
- email any/all details for APEX to Martin so we can think about PIPER integration.
- Write the main page documentation for APEX.
    - Introduction
    - Interface links
    - Installation
    - Library dependencies
    - Environment Variables
    - Usage Examples
    - Acknowledgements
- Add lots of comments to code for Doxygen documentation
- Add doxygen generation
- instrument HPX3 runtime directly, without ITT interface.
- "reset counters" support - all or individual or a set. Maybe just a set? hard to do with C interface?
    - By name
    - By address
- integrate HPX5 runtime modifications into a separate library - make it a policy?
- clean up HPX5 implementation
- make separate APEX support library in HPX5
- update to new source code structure in HPX5
    - make libapex_hpx (move from extras/apex)
- move throttling code to APEX repo for use in HPX3
- Get more application cases for HPX3
    - miniGhost
    - 1D stencil
- Get more application cases for HPX5
    - LULESH
    - libPXGL - sssp
- Use Cases:
    - throttling for memory / power (HPX5 LULESH, SSSP examples)
    - Changing number of threads dynamically for performance (Patricia Grubel example)
    - Online monitoring
- Periodic power measurement on Edison (using RCR or direct) - reads it directly.
- Periodic /proc/stat data on Edison (using RCR or direct) - APEX reads it directly, when available.
- OMPT support
    - Generic event handler interface
    - With an event stack?
- Verify TAU support
    - HPX-3
        - Profile
    - HPX-5
        - Profile
- Change all void* types in APEX to apex_function or whatever named type is appropriate
- Test with valgrind to check for leaks and potential memory errors?
- OMPT example
- Build everything on Edison
    - APEX - needs boost libraries added to package.
    - HPX5
    - HPX5 with APEX
    - HPX3
- When apex_finalize happens, stop all periodic policies!
- Move the throttling code to the APEX library
- Experiments without APEX:
    - Run application in parametric mode, with variable numbers of HPX threads.
        - LULESH
