# API Doxygen Reference

The source code is instrumented with Doxygen comments, and the API reference
manual can be generated by executing 'make doc' in the build directory, after
CMake configuration.  A fairly recent version of the API reference
documentation is available here:
<http://www.nic.uoregon.edu/~khuck/apex_docs/doc/html/index.html>

In the event that the [API specification](spec.md) and the reference implementation
(as generated by the Doxygen comments from the actual source code) do
not match, assume that the specification is correct and that the implementation
is non-compliant - and subsequently contact the project maintainers so that
we may bring the implementation into compliance.
